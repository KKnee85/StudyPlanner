# Kotlin Multiplatform project

This project is targeting Desktop (JVM), built with
the [Kotlin Toolchain](https://kotlin-toolchain.org/latest/).

- [/desktopApp](./desktopApp) contains the desktop (JVM) application.
- [/shared](./shared) holds the code shared across your applications — Compose UI,
  business logic, and platform-specific implementations. [src](./shared/src) is for common code; the
  sibling `src@<platform>` folders (for example `src@android`) hold code compiled only for the platform named in the
  folder.

The `kotlin` (macOS/Linux) and `kotlin.bat` (Windows) scripts in the project root are self-bootstrapping wrappers for
the Kotlin Toolchain: they download the pinned toolchain version on first use, so no separate installation is required.
Build the whole project with `./kotlin build`.

### Running

Run each module from the command line:

- Desktop app: `./kotlin run -m desktopApp`

### Testing

Run the project's tests with `./kotlin test`, or `./kotlin test -m <module>` for a single module.
